# Experience

## Google Developer Student Club NSUT, ML Department Mentor

- Nov 2024 – present
- Contributed to society projects such as **[makemore](https://github.com/SqrtNegativOne/makemore)** (character level text generator using **PyTorch**), [AI factchecking](https://github.com/SqrtNegativOne/AI-factcheck), and the code for the [Zero Day Apocalypse](https://unstop.com/hackathons/zero-day-apocalypse-shunya-netaji-subhas-university-of-technology-nsut-delhi-1549448) competition under the society's flagship event.
- Managed recruitment for 600+ applicants in the ML department, selecting less than 20 after [coding a dataset](https://github.com/SqrtNegativOne/competition-dataset-generation) for the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recruitment-task-for-gdsc-ml/overview) witnessing participation from 200+ teams from 4 countries, and conducting interviews.
- Ranked **[top 17%](https://www.kaggle.com/sqrtnegativ1/competitions)** in an international ML Kaggle competition with a team of three, using libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for EDA and baseline models.

## Team Debugging Society, ML Engineer

- Oct 2024 – present
- Organised and helped judge an [inter-college data science ML competition](https://unstop.com/hackathons/datasphere-data-analytics-challenge-spacecon-2025-netaji-subhas-university-of-technology-nsut-delhi-1382127) with 50+ participants.

# Projects

## [Backend for FloatChat: Conversational Interface for Oceanographic Data Visualisation](https://github.com/SqrtNegativOne/resume/blob/main/resources/SIH.pdf)

- Sept 2025 – Oct 2025
- Brainstormed with a 6-member team under a strict time limit to deliver a functional prototype for SIH 2025.
- Selected as one of the top 90 teams from over 200 teams in the college.
- Used **FastAPI** to build a **REST API** backend for modularity and compatibility with various frontends.
- Exposed an **MCP** interface to allow AI agents to connect with ARGO Oceanographic **API endpoints**.
- Used **PydanticAI** and **LangChain** to implement efficient **RAG** pipeline for context retrieval and response generation.
- Used **Docker** for containerization and easy deployment.

## [Modular AI Factchecking Pipeline](https://github.com/SqrtNegativOne/AI-factcheck)

- June 2025 – July 2025
- Implements a modular architecture for integration of web-scraping, NLP-based semantic search, and either LLM-based or NLI-based claim verification.
- Used local LLMs through **Ollama** for cost-efficiency.
- Used **LangChain** for **RAG** to achieve better accuracy and context-awareness.

## [Personal Website](https://github.com/SqrtNegativOne/sqrtnegativone.github.io)

- Oct 2024 – July 2025
- Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Typescript** with the Eleventy framework for blogging.
- Implements responsive-design, a markdown engine, and an RSS feed.

## [Hand Cricket Multi-Agent Bandit model](https://github.com/SqrtNegativOne/hand-cricket-MAB)

- June 2025 – June 2025
- Statically typed game-theoretic agent to win at Hand cricket by analyzing patterns in players' moves.
- Multi-armed-bandit using Experts-As-Arms model composed of **PyTorch neural networks**, n-Gram expert-models, and other heuristics weaved through the Hedge algorithm.
